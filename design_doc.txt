need to reimpliment timeline to actually show dance formations
right now the prototype version looks for a TestDroppable
change this to look for a dance formation preview
make dance formation buttons give a dance formation preview

Dance formation
can display on screen
can be selected with button
can be placed on timeline
can be edited
has an id to be referenced
has dancers

should i have some kind of singleton that holds all the of the formations and can be referenced using
id? 

formation emits a signal eveery time its changed, signal carries an array of positions
position array index correlates with dancer id
every formation dancers will have an id that's incremental
formation previews will be linked to this signal and update its preview whenever this signal is sent
	current_dancers = preview.get_children()
	for dancer_idx in range(formation_signal.size):
		if dancer_idx < current_dancers.size():
			current_dancers[dancer_idx].position = formation_signal[dancer_idx]
		else:
			var new_dancer.position = formation_signal[dancer_idx]

timeline will have timeline objects. timeline objects can be drag and dropped into the timeline.
formation_preview timeline object will inherit timeline object in order to emit the display formation signal

okay so what shouold i work on first? it feels like i should probably rework the formation scene so that it
can handle sending out the preview data signal. its get_preview func will also connect the preview to its
update signal before returning the preview
