need to reimpliment timeline to actually show dance formations
right now the prototype version looks for a TestDroppable
change this to look for a dance formation preview
make dance formation buttons give a dance formation preview

Dance formation
can display on screen
can be selected with button
can be placed on timeline
can be edited
has an id to be referenced
has dancers

should i have some kind of singleton that holds all the of the formations and can be referenced using
id?
